# Aurum Connect UI – Responsive Design Recreation

## 🔍 Approach

The goal was to recreate the provided UI design as closely as possible using **React** and **Next.js**, following a clean, component-driven approach based on **Atomic Design principles**. Each section of the homepage was broken down into reusable components (atoms, molecules, organisms), styled with **Tailwind CSS** for rapid and responsive development.

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Next.js 15** – App Router, optimized build
- **React 19** – Component-based architecture
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling
- **Lucide React** – Lightweight icon set
- **React Slick** – Carousel for testimonials
- **React Google Charts** – Activity line graph

## 🚧 Challenges Faced

- Ensuring **pixel-perfect matching** with the original design on both desktop and mobile views
- Handling **layout inconsistencies** like borders in responsive grids
- Mimicking specific UI behaviors (e.g., hover state on cards, button transitions, sticky transparent header)
- Matching **carousel styling and behavior** exactly as in the mockup without a UI framework

---

✅ The final result is a clean, scalable, and fully responsive web UI implementation, suitable for real-world use or portfolio projects.
